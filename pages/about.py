    <p class='center'>Urban gardens play a crutial role in the transformation and sustainability of cities due to their environmental and social benefits. As environmental benefits they contribute to improve the local environment and reduce the impact of climate change by mitigating air pollution, reducing the urban heat island effect and capturing carbon dioxide. On the social side, urban gardens serve as community hubs, bringing people together, fostering social interactions and creating spaces for neighbors to collaborate and share knowledge. Moreover, they bring educational opportunities for children and young adults to learn practical skills and understand the importance of sustainable food systems.</p>

            <p class='center'>The functionality of GreenAdvisor is simple yet powerful. Users can simply capture a photo of a vegetable using the tool, and thanks to its advanced neural network models, GreenAdvisor accurately detects the vegetable type. Moreover, users can then input their location and GreenAdvisor leverages this information to provide detailed plant-specific insights. The information offered by the tool includes optimal sowing times and methods based on the climate zone of the location, temperature and spacing requirements, harvesting guidlines and even compatibility or incompatibility with other plants. It becomes your personalized gardening advisor, offering tailored recommendations specific to your urban environment.</p>

It involves selecting appropriate trays with drainage holes, preparing a seed-starting mix, sowing the seeds at the recommended depth, and providing proper conditions such as light and temperature for germination. Regular monitoring and care are essential to maintain adequate moisture and prevent leggy growth. After hardening off, the seedlings can be transplanted into the outdoor garden. This method allows for early germination, controlled growing conditions, and an extended growing season.</p>
